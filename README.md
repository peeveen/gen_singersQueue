# gen_singersQueue
Winamp plugin to display queue of karaoke singers. Never be asked "Am I up next?" ever again!
* Reads list of singers (simple text file, one singer per line, line starts with a tab if no songs cued) and shows them in a window.
* Singers with no cued songs display in darker colour
* Resizable window
* Customizable font
* Window caption moves left and right to prevent screen burn
* Works "out of the box" with the singers list generated by [Karaoke Manager](https://github.com/peeveen/karaokemanager).
